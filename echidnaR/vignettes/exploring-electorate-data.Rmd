`echidnaR` is an R package that makes it easy to look at the data from the 2011 Australian Census.

This vignette (so far) documents how to access the data, and what it is.

The data is loaded as `abs2011`. Let's look take a brief glimpse of the data.

```{r load-read, message=FALSE, error = FALSE}
library(echidnaR)
library(dplyr)

glimpse(abs2011)

```

Here we see that we have 150 observations and 28 variables.

Each observation is data pertaining to a particular federal electorate as described by <url to the gov website of electorates>.

Each column is now described here:

```{r make-data-dictionary, include = FALSE}

# General usage

So let's just look at some nice and simple plots.

## Age


```{r}

library(tidyr)
library(ggplot2)

abs2011 %>%
  select(starts_with("Age"), Name) %>%
  gather(key = "Age",
         value = "Percent_in_electorate",
         -Name) %>% 
  ggplot(data = .,
         aes(x = Age,
             y = Percent_in_electorate,
             colour = Age)) +
  geom_boxplot() + 
  coord_flip() + 
  theme_minimal() + 
  theme(legend.position = "none") +
  labs(y = "% in Electorate")
             

```

## Unemployment 

```{r}

ggplot(data = abs2011,
       aes(x = Unemployed)) + 
  geom_density(fill = "salmon") + 
  geom_rug(colour = "salmon") +
  theme_minimal()

```


## Unemployment by state

```{r}

ggplot(data = abs2011,
       aes(x = reorder(State, -Unemployed),
           y = Unemployed,
           colour = State)) + 
  geom_boxplot() + 
  labs(x = "State",
       y = "% Unemployment") + 
  theme_minimal() + 
  theme(legend.position = "none") 
  
           
```


## Income

```{r}

ggplot(data = abs2011,
       aes(x = MedianIncome)) + 
  geom_density(fill = "salmon") + 
  geom_rug(colour = "salmon") + 
  theme_minimal()
  
```

## Income by State

```{r}

ggplot(data = abs2011,
       aes(x = reorder(State, -MedianIncome),
           y = MedianIncome,
           colour = State)) + 
  geom_boxplot() + 
  theme_minimal() + 
  theme(legend.position = "none") + 
  labs(x = "State")

```

Just a thought, you can add in the points to get a bit more information on the distribution

```{r}

ggplot(data = abs2011,
       aes(x = reorder(State, -MedianIncome),
           y = MedianIncome,
           colour = State)) + 
  geom_boxplot() + 
  geom_jitter(alpha = 0.35, 
              size = 0.5,
              width = 0.3) +
  theme_minimal() + 
  theme(legend.position = "none") + 
  labs(x = "State")

```

## Education

### Bachelor

```{r}

ggplot(data = abs2011,
       aes(x = Bachelor)) +
  geom_density(fill = "salmon") + 
  geom_rug(colour = "salmon") + 
  theme_minimal() + 
  labs(x = "% of individuals with a Bachelor degree")
           

```

### Bachelor by state

```{r}

ggplot(data = abs2011,
       aes(x = reorder(State, -Bachelor),
           y = Bachelor,
           colour = State)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(x = "State") + 
  theme(legend.position = "none")

```

### Bachelor and income

```{r}

ggplot(data = abs2011,
       aes(x = Bachelor,
           y = MedianIncome)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  theme_minimal()

```


## Postgraduate


```{r}

ggplot(data = abs2011,
       aes(x = reorder(State, -Postgraduate),
           y = Postgraduate,
           colour = State)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(x = "State") + 
  theme(legend.position = "none")

```

### Postgraduate and income

```{r}

ggplot(data = abs2011,
       aes(x = Postgraduate,
           y = MedianIncome)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  theme_minimal()
  
```

### Comparing income across Bachelors and postgraduate

```{r}

abs2011 %>%
  select(Postgraduate,
         Bachelor,
         MedianIncome) %>% 
  gather(key = "Education",
         value = "Prop_Educated",
         -MedianIncome) %>%
ggplot(data = ,
       aes(x = Prop_Educated,
           y = MedianIncome,
           colour = Education)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth() +
  theme_minimal() 
  # theme(legend.position = "bottom",
  #       legend.direction = "vertical")

```

## Religion

### Christian

### Catholic

# Spatial Mapping

One of the really amazing things about this R package is that it contains the shapefiles of the electorates. These are coming soon!

Some small gripes.

- Variable names: Should they not be capitalised?
- State names: These are capitalised for ACT and NSW, but not for Qld and Vic
